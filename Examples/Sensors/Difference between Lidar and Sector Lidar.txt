LIDAR gives the raw data of the Lidar sensor. The car will be able to see where exactly the object is and how far away it is.

SECTOR_LIDAR is a simplified version of LIDAR used in the console. It splits the area around the robot into 8 sectors. The car only knows if an object IS or IS NOT in a sector. May converge faster due to the binary input.
